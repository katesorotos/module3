OWASP Top 10 Most Critical Web Application Security Risks

Injection - 
Flaws occur when an attacker can send hostile data to an interpreter.
Untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. 
Injection flaws are easy to discover when examining code. Scanners and fuzzers can help attackers find injection flaws.
Can result in data loss, corruption, or disclosure to unauthorized parties, loss of accountability, or denial of access.
Injection can sometimes lead to complete host takeover.
The attacker’s hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.

Broken Authentication -
Application functions related to authentication and session management are often implemented
incorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or to exploit
other implementation flaws to assume other users’ identities temporarily or permanently.
Attackers have access to hundreds of millions of valid username and password combinations for credential
stuffing, default administrative account lists, automated brute force, and dictionary attack tools.
Attackers have to gain access to only a few accounts, or just one admin account to compromise the system. 
Depending on the domain of the application, this may allow money laundering, social security fraud, and identity theft, or disclose legally protected highly sensitive information.
